...\n... to safe datastore automation.\nReplicante is an open source data-driven automation system built specifically for datastores.\nAutomation is a known concept and there are some open source frameworks to implement it.\nTo remain general purpose, these frameworks mostly focus on providing an event bus and task\nscheduling with APIs to emit events and rules to react to them.\nWhile very powerful, this approach means it is up to the user to implement automations and tasks\nas well as monitoring triggers.\nThe result often is overly-specific, fragile, set-ups that are hard to manage and share.\nReplicante aims to avoid some of these shot-comings at the expense of generalisation:\na well defined specification document determines\nwhat a datastore is and can do.\nArmed with this knowledge replicante can natively emit events with useful and consistent context\nregardless of software in use or its version.\nWhere to start?\n\nRead the architecture overview to understand how the system fits together.\nWork through the quick start steps to setup a docker and docker-compose local playground.\nCheckout the features showcase if you are looking for something specific.\n\n"},"first-steps/architecture.html":{"url":"first-steps/architecture.html","title":"Architecture overview","keywords":"","body":"Architecture overview\nReplicante uses a central system

instructed by the central system.\n\nCentral system\nThe central system (replicante core) interacts with all the agents.\nThe main purpose is to aggregate agents state to emit events and to react to

start","keywords":"","body":"Quick start\nThis guide will go through the steps needed to setup a local, docker based, playground\nto test out replicante core and the official agents.\nBy the end you should have a full system running that can be used to experiment with and\ndemo all replicante features and behaviours.\nPlease note: this guide does not explain how to install and configure replicante\nfor production use and it does not attempt to cover all possible configuration options\nand installation and management details.\nSimplified networking: to keep commands and configurations simple subnets are\nstatically configured with agent containers having static IPs.\n1. Getting the code\nThe playground is a git repo containing\na set of docker-compose projects.\nEach docker-compose project runs a full cluster and its agents.\nThere is also a docker-compose project to run replicante core with all its dependencies.\nDetails about each project can be found in the README.md file of the project but generally:\n\nAll projects are self-bootstrapping: just docker-compose up and a configuration script will run too.\nEach project has an additional docker-compose-agents.yaml file to run the agents too.\nAfter images are pulled/built there is no more need for internet access.\n\n$ git clone --recoursive https://github.com/replicante-io/playgrounds.git\n$ cd playgrounds\n\n\n\n\n2. Running a MongoDB replica set\nIn this example we will run a MongoDB three node replica set configuration with agents.\nThe same commands can be used to run any number of playgrounds so they will not be repeated.\nStart the docker compose project.\nThe first time, this will pull and build images as needed.\nKeep in mind that initialisation can take up to a minute.\nThe optional -d runs the processes in the background if you don't care for the logs.\n$ cd mongo/rs\n$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-agents.yml up [-d]\n\n\n\nMake sure that the controller process exited with a zero code and all other processes are up.\n$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-agents.yml ps\n     Name                    Command               State             Ports\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nrs_agent1_1       /replicante/agents/target/ ...

Start replicante core and the WebUI\nJust like other projects, a initialisation script is run to initialise and configure datastores\nif needed.\nIt could take a couple of minutes to initialise everything the first time.\nThe configuration defaults to discovering all nodes for the clusters available in the playground\nand runs the API and WebUI on port 16016 and 3000 respectively.\n$ cd tools/replicore/\n$ docker-compose up\n\n\n\nIf you see any errors about missing networks you may need to have other playgrounds\ncreate their networks first.\ncd path/to/missing/project\n$ docker-compose up --no-build --no-start\n\n\n\n\nOnce everything is up and running the WebUI will be available at http://localhost:3000/:\n\n4. Experimenting with the playground\nNow that all processes are up and running we can interfear with systems and see what happens.\nTry things like:\n\nStop/start datanodes and/or agents.\nFail over pimaries.\nUse the awesome kernel features and tools to symulate network issues (tc) and other limits (cgroups).\n\n5. Clean up\nEach cluster runs as a signle docker-compose project and stores data in a local ./data directory.\nTo clean up after you no longer need these processes remove all the docker containers and images\nand all data in ./data.\n$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-agents.yml down --rmi all --volumes\n\n\n"},"setup/deps.html":{"url":"setup/deps.html","title":"Dependencies","keywords":"","body":"Runtime dependencies\nReplicante attempts to limit the number of required dependencies to avoid management overhead.\nOn the other hand it is unwise to re-implement complex systems (such as databases) if there is no need.\nIn order to run, replicante requires the following:\n\nA storage layer.\nA distributed coordinator (not needed yet).\nAn event streaming platform (not needed yet).\n\nNote: while the distributed coordinator and event streaming platform are not needed in the\nfirst release, they are mentioned because they will be required from the next release.\nIf you are assessing your ability to manage an installation you should account for them.\nStorage layer\nUsed to persist the information collected from agents, generated metadata, and any other permanent\ndata that is required by replicante to implement its features.\nSupported systems:\n\nMongoDB (recommended)\n\nDistributed coordinator\nReplcante (will) support high availability, machine failure tolerance, and horizontal scaling.\nTo achieve all this replicante runs multiple instances of the same process on different machines (or VMs).\nThe coordinator is a component (itself also highly available) that allows the distribution of work\nacross all processes as well as the re-distribution of work assigned to failed processes.\nSupported systems:\n\nZookeeper (recommended)\n\nEvent streaming platform\nEvents generated by replicante are emitted onto a streaming platform.\nThis provides two advantages:\n\nReplicante has a reliable event bus as the base for an event driven architecture.\nOther tools can process emitted events to implement extra features and integrations.\n\nSupported systems:\n\nKafka (recommended)\n\nOptional dependencies\nSome features rely on additional runtime dependencies.\nTo keep the set of required dependencies to a minimum these features must be enabled explicitly.\nThe needed systems and configuration details are documented within the features that need them.\n"},"setup/install.html":{"url":"setup/install.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"Installation\nThis page documents the step to install replicante for production use.\nIt does NOT detail the installation process of the needed dependences.\nIf you are looking for a development/test/demo environment the\nquick start guide is where you can find all that.\n1. Installing dependencies\nThe first step is to install all the required dependencies.\nAs the process depends on the chosen solution this guide does not cover how.\nFor production installation it is strongly recommended that all dependences\nsupport and are installed and configured in highly available mode.\nWhen using the recommended set of dependencies these guides may be of help:\n\nStorage layer: MongoDB - https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.6/installation/\nDistributed coordinator: Zookeeper - http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.12/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_zkMulitServerSetup\nEvent streaming platform: Kafka - https://kafka.apache.org/11/documentation.html#quickstart\n\n2.

configured, runs perfectly without ever needing attention.\nOf course reality tells a different story.\nSoftware bugs and evolution, transient network issues, miss-configurations ...\nMany things can go wrong and the symptoms are often unclear.\nDistributed systems also mean that errors often propagate across processes\nand servers so the error location is far from the error origin.\nOn top of all that, distributed systems are complex to follow and\nsimple questions about correct functioning become hard to answer.\nReplicante is a distributed system and as such it is subject to all the above complications.\nTo help users and administrators understand and manage installations, as well as troubleshoot issues,\nReplicante provides a set of features to introspect the system and trace its activity.\nEvents trail\nReplicante is an event-driven system at its core.\nBecause of that, most activities of the system can be explained and monitored by looking at events.\nThe events section explains how to view and programmatically follow events.\nMetrics\nInformation about internal operation of replicante is exposed through metrics.\nThese can be used to monitor the health and activity of a process as well as its performance.\nMetrics are exposed in Prometheus format by the API endpoint /api/v1/metrics.\nLogging\nLogging is a good way to see exactly what one system was doing at a precise point in time.\nReplicante provides structured logging so administrators can see what is happening and in what context.\nBy itself this is needed but not that great.\nThe real power of structured logging comes in with centralised log collection:\nthe logs from every server are collected and indexed in a central location along with other services.\nConfiguration\nVarious logging backends are supported so that replicante can fit into your infrastructure\nand some options are provided to user regardless of the backend of choice.\nAll options are under the logging section.\nThe details are documented in the configuration reference.\nBelow are the supported backends:\n\njson (default) outputs logs to standard output in JSON format:\nThe output is not the easiest to read directly.\nIt works well with process supervisors that expect logs from standard output (i.e, docker).\nLines can be processed by any tools that understand JSON (i.e, jq or crafted scripts).\n\n\njournald sends logs to journald directly (systemd's logging facility):\njournald is available only if enabled at compile time.\njournald is requires a server running systemd.\n\n\n\nDistributed Tracing\nFollowing the details of an operation from start to finish when it spans several servers\ncan be a challenge.\nThankfully there are tools to address this challenge: distributed tracers.\nDistributed tracers are central systems that collect segments of operations from different servers\nand combine them together to show the entire story of a full operation.\nConfiguration\nReplicante supports integration with some distributed tracing tools compatible with the\nOpenTracing specification.\nBy default distributed tracing is disabled but it can be configured\nwith the options under the tracing section.\n"},"security/considerations.html":{"url":"security/considerations.html","title":"Security considerations","keywords":"","body":"Security considerations\nThis section covers Replicante security design and features.\nReplicante aims to provide a reasonable level of security by default but will require tuning\nto ensure the configuration meats your requirements.\nDesign expectations\nReplicante is developed with some expectation about data, users, and runtime environment:\n\nAgents can be trusted and respect the specification.\nUsers that have access to the system can be trusted.\nReplicante processes can trust each other.\nAgent actions can be harmful so the authenticity and integrity of action requests must be guaranteed.\nCollected data and generated events are sensitive information (precautions are taken to avoid\nunauthorised reads) but are not confidential (no permanent or irreparable harm is done if data\nis leaked).\nSecurity of third party software (store, message bus, ...) is out of scope.\n\nFeatures\nReplicante provides the following security-related features:\n\nAgents transport encryption and action signing.\nEvents auditing.\n\n"},"security/transport.html":{"url":"security/transport.html","title":"Agent transports","keywords":"","body":"Agent transports\nReplicante core issues commands to the agents.\nThis design simplifies the agent interaction logic and allows for dynamic scaling controlled at core.\nBy default, communication with agents is performed over HTTP(s) as detailed below.\nThis approach makes the system easy to develop, debug, and interact with.\nUsing HTTP(s) as the transport layer also allows access to many existing tools for any need.\nReplicante may at some point include other agent transports.\nUnimplemented feature warning\nThis page makes several mentions to agent actions.\nThis feature is not yet implemented but it will be a key part of the system.\nFor that reason they are planned for from the early stages.\n\nTransport security\nBecause a network is (likely) involved in the core-agent communication there are\nsome security aspects that must be considered and precautions to take.\nThere are two main ways for the transport to be abused:\n\nAgent information and monitoring data could be faked.\nThis would lead Replicante to infer the incorrect state of the node and issue corrective\nactions that could harm the healthy node.\nActions sent to agents could be faked.\nThis would cause the agents to take actions that are issued with malignant intent.\n\nThere is also the possibility of packets being dropped by the transport layer.\nThis could result in a luck of visibility and/or an inability to issue actions to the node.\nBecause such event is indistinguishable from a regular network outage there is not much\nthat can be done to defend the system against this kind of attacks.\nReplicante delegates securing the network to the transport layer.\nHTTP(s) transport\nThe HTTP transport is the easiest to use but also the least secure.\nWith this transport Replicante core act as an HTTP client for the agent.\nConnections are established by replicante core and closed when no longer needed to avoid all\nthe complexity of long-running TCP connections (i.e, need for heart-beats, reconnect logic)\nalthough this comes at the cost of repeated TPC connection handshakes.\nAs mentioned, HTTP is an insecure protocol but there are ways to add security to it.\nMost notable is the HTTPS protocol which solves the agent's identity and message\nintegrity part of the equation.\nOnce the identity of the agent is verified by HTTPS and the channel is encrypted\nit is possible to verify the identity and message integrity by signing messages:\n\nReplicante core will use a signing (private) key to sign sensitive messages before they are sent.\nReplicante agents will use a verification (public) key to verify the signature of messages.\n\nThe HTTP transport was mainly inspired by the advantages shown by\nPrometheus\nbut also for the added benefit of a simpler scalability architecture for replicante core.\nConfiguration\nAt the time of writing HTTPS can be configured on agents through an HTTPS proxy server.\n"},"upgrades/rolling.html":{"url":"upgrades/rolling.html","title":"Rolling upgrades","keywords":"","body":"Rolling upgrades\nNo software is perfect and few are ever complete.\nUpdates are, or should be, part of the day to day operations.\nThis document describes the steps you can follow to upgrade Replicante without service interruption.\nNote: this document does NOT describe how to update replicante's dependencies.\nYou should take care to keep them up to date as well.\nThe upgrade path relies on Replicante high availability features to avoid loss of service.\nNodes are updated one at a time, upgrading them between compatible versions.\nOnce all nodes are up to date and restarted the upgrade is complete.\n\nRead the release notes for any special consideration for the version you are upgrading to.\nObtain a copy of the code to update to (see the install section).\nTest configuration and store contents compatibility (see replictl check upgrade).\nFor each Replicante server:\nInstall the new binary.\nRestart the process on the node.\nCheck the logs to ensure everything works as expect.\n\n\n\nOnce the upgrade is complete you should review the configuration to enable new options\nand disable any deprecated features.\nChanges to data schema\nAny software that persist data needs to deal with changes to the schema as the software evolves.\nReplicante tries to avoid the need for migrations by gradually rolling out changes to the data.\nWhen the data schema needs to change:\n\nA minor version is released to introduce the changes as optional:\nNew attributes are added and always set but expected to be missing.\nDeprecated attributes are no longer used but still set.\n\n\nAs clusters are updated collected and generated data will have the new schema.\nA major version is released expecting the data to have the new schema:\nNew attributes are no longer optional and decoding data without them fails.\nDeprecated attributes are no longer used or set.\n\n\n\nUpgrading to major releases\nAlways run the latest minor release before upgrades to the next major release.\nThe approach above works because replicante expires historical data and refreshes monitoring data.\nYou may need to run the latest minor release until all data items are expired or refreshed.\nThe replictl check upgrade command can scan your dataset\nto ensure all items are compatible with the new
