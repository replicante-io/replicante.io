## Replicante Code of Conduct - Enforcement Manual

This is the enforcement manual followed by the Code of Conduct Committee.
It's used when we respond to an issue to make sure we're consistent and fair.
It should be considered an internal document, but we're publishing it publicly in the interests of transparency.

### The Code of Conduct Committee

All responses to reports of conduct violations will be managed by a Code of Conduct Committee ("the committee").

### How the committee will respond to reports

When a report is sent to the committee they will immediately reply to the
report to confirm receipt. This reply must be sent within 24 hours, and the
committee should strive to respond much quicker than that.

See the [reporting guidelines](/conduct/reporting) for details of
what reports should contain. If a report doesn't contain enough information, the
committee will obtain all relevant data before acting.

The committee will then review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:

  * what happened
  * whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation
  * who, if anyone, was the bad actor
  * whether this is an ongoing situation, and there is a threat to anyone's physical safety

This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the
committee's deliberations will be recorded and retained (i.e. IRC transcripts, email
discussions, recorded voice conversations, etc).

The committee should aim to have a resolution agreed upon within one week.
In the event that a resolution can't be determined in that time, the committee will
respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline for resolution.

### Acting Unilaterally

If the act is ongoing, or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence),
any committee member may act immediately (before reaching consensus) to end the situation.
In ongoing situations, any member may at their discretion employ any of the tools available
to the committee, including bans and blocks.

If the incident involves physical danger, any member of the committee may --
and should -- act unilaterally to protect safety. This can include contacting
law enforcement (or other local personnel).

In situations where an individual committee member acts unilaterally, they must
report their actions to the committee for review within 24 hours.

### Resolutions

The committee must agree on a resolution by consensus.

Possible responses may include:

  * Taking no further action (if we determine no violation occurred).
  * A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s) involved.
    In this case, a committee member will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s)
    over email, cc'ing the committee.
  * A public reprimand. In this case, a committee member will deliver that reprimand
    in the same venue that the violation occurred (i.e. in IRC for an IRC violation;
    email for an email violation, etc.). The committee may choose to publish this message
    elsewhere for posterity.
  * An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a mailing list
    or IRC). A committee member will communicate this "vacation" to the individual(s).
    They'll be asked to take this vacation voluntarily, but if they don't agree then
    a temporary ban may be imposed to enforce this vacation.
  * A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Replicante spaces (mailing lists, IRC,
    etc.). The committee will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be
    reviewed in the future, extended to new fora, or otherwise maintained.
  * A request for a public or private apology. a committee member will deliver this request.
    The committee may, if it chooses, attach "strings" to this request: for example,
    the committee may ask a violator to apologize in order to retain his or her membership
    on a mailing list.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the committee
will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain
the proposed resolution. The committee will ask if this resolution is
acceptable, and must note feedback for the record. However, the committee is
not required to act on this feedback.

### Records of reports
Each report is given a unique ID based on the date the incident occurred.
If the date the incident occurred on is not clear or indicated in the initial report,
the date the first report about the incident is used.

The report ID is thus in the form: `YYYY-MM-DD#N`.
`N` is a counter starting at 1 and incremented for every report on that day,
with the hope it never has to grow.

Information about an incident, details of the investigation, decisions, and resolutions,
are recorded in the form of emails sent to the [conduct@replicante.io](mailto:conduct@replicante.io) address.
Members of the conduct commette must ensure information is recorded in this way ASAP.
Internal emails to detail handling of reports must have subjects starting with `[REPORT_ID]`.

Records of an incident will be kept for at least a year since the date of the event
or initial report, whichever is earliest.
Records may be kept for longer if they relate to repeating or significant events,
at the commette discretion.

Records may be shared with relevant law enforcement if necessary and appropriate.
Access to the records will otherwise be restricted to the commette alone.
