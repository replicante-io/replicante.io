Some datastore agents are maintained by the Replicante Project directly.

Official agents are not special to the comunity or the project but do evolve
more closely with Replicante Core itself.

This is a list of agents currently supported as part of the Replicante Project:

  * [Kafka]({{< ref "./kafka.md" >}})
  * [MongoDB]({{< ref "./mongo.md" >}})
  * [Zookeeper]({{< ref "./zookeeper.md" >}})
