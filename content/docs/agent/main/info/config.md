As agents are developed as independent programs, configuration options
(and even configuration format) differ from agent to agent.

Official agents and those implemented using the base rust crate provide a set of standard
configuration options as well as agent specific options.

All common options are documented in the [example configuration file]
at the root of the repo while agent specific options are documented with the agents details.

[example configuration file]: {{< versioned "https://github.com/replicante-io/agents/blob/{version}/agents/agent.example.yaml" >}}
