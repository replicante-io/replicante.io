Initially playbooks will be a sequence of stages and actions targeting nodes in a cluster.

It may be cool to support playbooks that can target different clusters at different stages.  
Or nodes across different clusters (maybe by cluster type? i.e, for all mongo 2.4.x nodes cry).

Playbooks and stuff is not implemented yet so start with easy cases and expand as needed.
