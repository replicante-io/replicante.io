Playbooks should become significantly more powerful if variables were an option.

This would allow playbooks to be defined with variables that are set at the time
the playbook is scheduled for execution against a cluster.

As use cases are very much unknown it is best to implement playbooks first
and then revisit the idea once a more concrete need for variable appears.
