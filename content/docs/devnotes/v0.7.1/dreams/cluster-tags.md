Support arbitrary user tags on clusters.

This can be used to:

* Search for clusters by tag (in the UI).
* Create reports/notifications per tag (tag all clusters needed by an app,
  when any of them fail notify of possible impact to the app).
* ID clusters by data-center/availability zone (helpful to detect large scale outages).
