Everyone wants a stable, fully-featured, performant software.

In a rush to get to super awesome softwate architectures with bind boggling performance,
correctness and essential needs are sometimes forgotten.

I have personally made that mistake at least once (and probably more).
In an attempt to avoid repeating the past I have decided to use documentation in place of
premature optimization.

At every stage when the idea or desire for a refactor surfices, changes to existing features
are though of for performance improvements, large changes are needed to open up the possibility
of a new potential feature: stop an think at what would be delayed by this!

If there is no immediate need to implement optimizations or refactors write all the idea down
in a document in this section detailing what is to be done, why and how it would help,
and why were these changes delayed.

Of course refactors and optimizations should **NOT** be rejected or ignored when needed:

  * First of all, they often present some quite interesting challenges.
  * Secondly, it comes a time when optimizations and refactoring are **NEEDED and they should
    not be delayed** without good reasons.
    There is a middle ground between do them now and do them never!
  * Optimisations and refactoring to make feature implementation easier is good.
    They should only be avoided if **premature** (is the code slow or *supected* to be slow?
    Is that easier-to-implement-after-refactor feature *guaranteed* to be implemented?).
