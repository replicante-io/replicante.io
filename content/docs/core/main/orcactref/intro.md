Replicante Core uses actions to manage orchestrate clusters.
In this section the available orchestrator actions Replicante Core offers are detailed.

In general, orchestrator actions are scheduled by appling an `OrchestratorAction` object
with the specification expected by the action `kind`.

These specifications are the focus, covering supported arguments as well as actions behaviour.

For details on actions overall refer to the
[actions features page]({{< ref "../features/actions.md" >}}).
