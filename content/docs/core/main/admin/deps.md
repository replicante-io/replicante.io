Replicante attempts to limit the number of required dependencies to avoid management overhead.
On the other hand it is unwise to re-implement complex systems (such as databases) if there is no need.

In order to run, replicante requires the following:

  * A storage layer.
  * A distributed coordinator.
  * An event streaming platform.


## Storage layer
Used to persist the information collected from agents, generated metadata, and any other permanent
data that is required by replicante to implement its features.

Supported systems:

  * [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (recommended)


## Distributed coordinator
Replcante supports high availability, machine failure tolerance, and horizontal scaling.  
To achieve this Replicante runs multiple instances of the same process on different machines (or VMs).

A distributed coordinator is a system (itself also highly available) that allows the coordination
of work across all processes as well as the re-distribution of work assigned to failed processes.

Supported systems:

  * [Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) (recommended)


## Event streaming platform
Events generated by Replicante are emitted onto a streaming platform.
This provides two advantages:

  1. Replicante has a reliable event bus as the base for an event driven architecture.
  2. Other tools can process emitted events to implement extra features and integrations.

Supported systems:

  * [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) (recommended)


## Optional dependencies
Some features may rely on additional runtime dependencies.
To keep the set of required dependencies to a minimum these features must be enabled explicitly.

The needed systems and configuration details are documented within the features that need them.
