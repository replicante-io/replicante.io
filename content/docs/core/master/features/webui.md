Replicante comes with a lightweight web-based user interface.
The main purpose of which is to visualise collected information and events.

The WebUI aims to be minimal and self-explicatory so just install it and click around.


## Install
### With Docker
A docker image with the pre-built WebUI is available:
https://hub.docker.com/r/replicanteio/webui

To use it, simply pull it and start it:
```bash
docker pull replicanteio/webui:v0
docker run --rm -it \
  -p 3000:3000 -e 'REPLI_BACKEND_ROOT=http://replicante.api:16016'
  replicanteio/webui:v0
```

### From code
The WebUI lives in a dedicated repository and is an nodejs application.
It can be installed by fetching the code, installing dependences, building static assets.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/replicante-io/webui.git
cd webui/
npm install
npm run build
```

All the WebUI needs to work now is the address of the replicante API server.
This should be passed in through environment variables.

```bash
export REPLI_BACKEND_ROOT="http://localhost:16016"
npm run server
```
