{{% notice class="warning" %}}
**Alpha state disclaimer**

The protocol defined below is in early development cycle
and is subject to (potentially breaking) change.
{{% /notice %}}


<div class="rest">
  <div class="method get">GET</div>
  <div class="url get">/api/unstable/actions/finished</div>
  <div class="desc get rtl">Returns a list of finished actions</div>
</div>

Actions MUST be listed in order from newest to oldest.

When an action is finished, the agent will never change its state.

Finished actions should be cleaned up periodically to prevent this list
from growing too large and the agent state from taking over the node.

A list of finished actions MUST include:

  * The action ID.
  * The final action state.

And it MAY include:

  * The action kind.

Example:
```json
[
    {
        "kind": "replicante.store.stop",
        "id": "703824bf-2c16-44f5-b4da-b21688c57043",
        "state": "DONE"
    },
    {
        "kind": "replicante.store.stop",
        "id": "f4fdda3f-3130-474b-b22c-66c6824a5d89",
        "state": "DONE"
    },
    {
        "kind": "replicante.store.stop",
        "id": "191cc19b-2dee-4013-b908-29c7985f79ac",
        "state": "DONE"
    }
]
```


<div class="rest">
  <div class="method get">GET</div>
  <div class="url get">/api/unstable/actions/queue</div>
  <div class="desc get rtl">Returns a list of currently running or queued actions</div>
</div>

Actions MUST be listed in order from oldest to newest.

The format of elements in this list is the same as the one of items
returned by `/api/unstable/actions/finished`.

Example:
```json
[
    {
        "kind": "replicante.store.stop",
        "id": "703824bf-2c16-44f5-b4da-b21688c57043",
        "state": "RUNNING"
    },
    {
        "kind": "replicante.store.stop",
        "id": "f4fdda3f-3130-474b-b22c-66c6824a5d89",
        "state": "NEW"
    },
    {
        "kind": "replicante.store.stop",
        "id": "191cc19b-2dee-4013-b908-29c7985f79ac",
        "state": "NEW"
    }
]
```


<div class="rest">
  <div class="method get">GET</div>
  <div class="url get">/api/unstable/actions/info/:id</div>
  <div class="desc get rtl">Returns an action details as well as its state history</div>
</div>

The following parameters are REQUIRED in the URL:

  * `:id`: the ID of the action to lookup.

The response will include the following information:

  * `action`: the full action model as described in the [protocol section](agent-intro.md#actions).
  * `history`: array of action transition events:
    * `action_id`: (optional) ID of the action that transition.
                   If set, this MUST be the same as `action.id`.
    * `timestamp`: the (agent) time the action entered the state.
    * `state`: the state that was reached.
    * `state_payload`: optional JSON value defined by the action at the time of transition.

Example:
```json
{
    "action": {
        "kind": "replicante.service.gracefulrestart",
        "created_ts": "2019-08-30T20:40:24Z",
